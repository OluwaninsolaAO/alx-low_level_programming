def island_perimeter(grid):
    """
    Returns the perimeter of the island
    decribed in grid:
    + grid is a list of list of integers:
      - 0 represents a water zone
      - 1 represents a land zone
      - One cell is a square with side length 1
      - Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
      - Grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100

    Approach:
    Using this simple model that iterate over all items in the grid,
    e.g. grid = [
                  [0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 1, 1, 0],
                  [0, 1, 0, 0],
                  [0, 1, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0]
                ]
    Given a return variable `perimeter` set to `0`:
    Logic: for each items in the grid,for top, bottom, right, or left
    sides that is not `1` increase the perimeter by `1` unit.

    Starting with the assumption that width is going to be equal
    accross all row in the grid.
