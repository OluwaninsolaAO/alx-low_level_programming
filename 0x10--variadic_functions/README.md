__Project Name:__ ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING
__Project Scope:__ Project Task 0x10 C - Variadic Functions
__Project Details:__ Similar to how main function takes numbers of arguments on invocation, variadic functions can take numbers of arguements of any type without explicitly defining them while declaring the function. Unlike main function which takes in numbers of arguement and saved them in an array, variadic functions can be accessed using stdarg.h which provides numbers of types and macro to access the passed arguements to the variadic function. This section explores how to use the macros and type in stdarg.h.
