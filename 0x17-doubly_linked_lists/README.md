__Project Name:__ ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING

__Project Scope:__ Project Task 0x17 C - Doubly linked lists

__Project Details:__ Unlike Singly linked lists, which members of the list
can be tracked right from the head down to the last elements in the list,
Doubly linked lists has each of its elements linked with two pointers -
prev and next to facilitate fast forward and backtracking on the elements
in the lists. More about this in this section.
