# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

A search algorithm is an algorithm that is designed to search for
a particular item or a set of items in a data structure. In the C
programming language, there are various search algorithms that can
be used to search for an element in an array or a linked list.

commonly used search algorithms in C include linear search, binary
search, and interpolation search. 

+ Linear search is a simple search algorithm that checks each element
of an array or a linked list until it finds the desired element.

+ Binary search, on the other hand, is a more efficient search algorithm
that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the
desired element is found.

+ Interpolation search is a variation of binary search that uses
interpolation to estimate the position of the desired element in
the array or linked list.

The choice of search algorithm depends on the size and complexity of the
data structure being searched, as well as the specific requirements of
the search. For small data structures, linear search may be sufficient,
but for large data structures, binary search or interpolation search may
be more efficient. It is important to choose the right search algorithm
to ensure efficient searching and avoid unnecessary overhead.
